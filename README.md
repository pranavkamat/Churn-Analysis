# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

## 🧠 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes **customer churn** to help businesses understand why customers leave and how to improve retention.  
The dashboard provides insights into churn trends, customer demographics, and service-related factors influencing churn.

This project was inspired by the YouTube tutorial by [*“Pivotalstats”*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFDslca5AX8) and recreated from scratch with my own data cleaning, transformations, and visual design improvements.
